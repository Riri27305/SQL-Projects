## 📁 Repository Contents

### 1. `LibraryManagementSystem.sql`
A complete SQL-based **Library Management System** containing:
- Database creation and table definitions (`Branch`, `Employee`, `Customer`, `Books`, `IssueStatus`, `ReturnStatus`)
- Data population with realistic entries
- A comprehensive set of 10+ queries covering:
  - Joins
  - Aggregations
  - Nested queries
  - Foreign keys
  - ENUMs and constraints
- Real-world business logic like book issue/return tracking

### 2. `LibraryDataset_xlsx.xlsx`
An optional supplementary dataset file (Excel format) that can be used for data import, validation, or report generation related to the Library Management System.

### 3. `Company database and queries.docx`
This document outlines the creation of a **Company Database** along with 10 sample queries. It demonstrates how to:
- Implement employee and departmental data
- Execute basic SQL retrieval and join operations
- Format output for result interpretation

### 4. `Creating database and querying.docx`
Builds a **Student-Society Database Schema** suitable for a college or university system. It includes:
- SQL scripts to create tables: `Student`, `Society`, and `Enrollment`
- 30 advanced SQL queries covering:
  - Subqueries
  - Aggregates
  - Views
  - Pattern matching
  - Date-based filtering
  - Table modification operations

### 5. `querying_using_python.docx`
Demonstrates executing SQL queries through **Python (using MySQL connector)**. It includes:
- Python scripts to connect to a MySQL database
- Real-time data retrieval examples
- Parameterized queries for secure execution
- Updating data and using conditional logic
> 🔒 *Note: The database credentials used (`root` / `RiyaGarg@sql`) are sample credentials; please replace them for security.*
